# chad-bot
discord bot for music (shitty design but idk man)



uhh i shall explain here cuz i provide no documentation of my code


basically, the bot uses discord4j and your discord dev token or whatever tf its called which IS PASSED THROUGH ARGS
then you need to get a google dev api key and allow to make yt queries
but google also doesnt wanted to get ddossed (understandable), so they have a limit on the searches you do
to get around this, I map searches with the appropriate link to a file, which means i can still play shit if i use up the limit (quota i believe is the correct term)

the bot itself is incredibly basic, play, loop, and skip commands exist, and there is a display for the song queue
it is still buggy, and i prob wont update this so if you find a bug, fix it yourself
